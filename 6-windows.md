# Lesson 6 - dealing with Windows machines

Start the emulator with this command:

    /net/ens/qemunet/qemunet.sh -s /net/ens/qemunet/demo/win.tgz -c /net/ens/qemunet/qemunet-win.cfg

This is the topology of the network you just started:

               win
                 |
           --------------   
                 | (eth1)
    gateway   immortal
                 | (eth0)
           --------------  
             |        |
            nile     syl  

The login for the Linux machines is "root" as usual, and the windows machine has user "**foo**", password "**toto**".

In order to do anything on windows, you should first


    Note : Under Windows, we will use the command prompt in administrator mode - the equivalent of a Linux shell. To do this, press the windows key (or click the windows logo bottom left), type in `cmd`, and right-click on this program to select: Run as Administrator.


- **(A)** What is the IP address of the Windows machine? What is its network mask? Look in the control panel. Do you know why that is the case?
- **(B)** On Windows: run the command prompt in Administrator mode. Using commands `ipconfig.exe` and `netsh.exe`, view and change the IP address of the Windows machine and give him the address 192.168.0.2/24. Write down the commands you used in your report, and show me a screenshot of the new IP set in the windows control panel.
- **(C)** Configure the `immortal` Linux machine in the same network as the Windows machine (`immortal` gets IP 192.168.0.1 on eth1). Ping `win10` to `immortal` and vice versa. What do you notice?
- **(D)** Disable the firewall of the Windows machine in Control Panel> System and Security> Windows Firewall . Check that the pings are now working in both directions ...
- **(E)** Now configure all Linux machines: IP addresses and routing table. (`immortal` gets 192.168.1.1 on eth0, `nile` gets 192.168.1.2 and `syl` gets 192.168.1.3)
- **(F)** On `win10`, run the command prompt again in Administrator mode. Add a default route to the Windows machine by using the `route.exe` command. Check with ping that all machines can talk to each other. Show me the `route` command you used a screenshot of `nile` successfully pinging `win10`.
- **(G)** Activate the firewall again. In the advanced settings of the Windows Firewall add a rule to allow incoming ping. To do this, select Incoming Traffic Rules and then add a New>Custom Rule, which allows the ICPMv4 protocol. Ensure that Linux machines can ping Windows. Show me a nice picture.
