# Lesson 2 - Routing

To start the virtual network with the configuration of the TP2,  run the following command:

    # first you need to update this repository on your PC
    cd ~/course-2018-networks
    git pull

    # then start QemuNet
    /net/ens/qemunet/qemunet.sh -x -s ~/course-2018-networks/gw0.tgz

The parameters do the following:
- `-s [filename].tgz` loads the saved session
- `-x` runs the emulation in a terminal instead of full screen (better if you have multiple windows/emulations open)

Here is the network configuration for this exercise:

               grave
                 | .2
             ------------  192.168.100.0/24
                 | .1 (eth0)
    Gateway   immortal
                 | .1 (eth1)             
           --------------  192.168.200.0/24
          .2 |        | .3              
          opeth      syl      

## Simple Routing

- **(A)** Configure the network interfaces of the different machines according to the diagram above. Use the ifconfig command. Be careful not to confuse `eth0` and `eth1`! Check with 'ping' that each pair of machines can communicate. Include a screenshot of `immortal` pinging `grave` and `immortal` pinging `syl`
- **(B)** Display the routing tables with the `route -n` command. Describe what you see.
- **(C)** What's the difference between the two multi-network routing methods described in http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/04/route-examples/ and http://www.techrepublic.com/article/understand-the-basics-of-linux-routing/
- **(D)** Configure the routing tables of the different machines using the `route` command. Below are some syntax examples. Check with `ping` that all machines are able to communicate with each other.
- **(E)** Ping between `opeth` and `grave`. Run `tcpdump -i any` on `immortal` to see the traffic. What do you notice?

## Advanced Routing (Bonus)

Before you continue, please `poweroff` all currently running machines.

This next network can be started with the command

    /net/ens/qemunet/qemunet.sh -x -s /net/ens/qemunet/demo/chain0.tgz

Here is a new configuration, consisting of the following 4 subnets: 147.210.12.0/24, 147.210.13.0/24, 147.210.14.0/24 and 147.210.15.0/24.

    eth0           eth0           eth1           eth0
    12.1           12.2           14.1           14.2
    ------------------           --------------------
     |              |              |              |
     |              |              |              |
    opeth      immortal         grave            syl          nile
                    |              |              |             |
                    |              |              |             |
                  --------------------          -------------------
                   13.1          13.2            15.1         15.2
                   eth1          eth0            eth1         eth0

First off these network addresses are bad - meaning in a private network, you should use the address range 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255. Therefore please change the ip addresses of the machine from `147.210.12.1` to `192.168.12.1`, and `147.210.13.1` to `192.168.13.1`, and so on.

Then please set up routing like depicted above, so that `opeth` (192.168.12.1) can ping `nile` (192.168.15.2).
- **(F)** set up `tcpdump -i any` on grave, then login to `opeth` and ping `nile` from `opeth`. Explain what happens (explain what you can see in the `tcpdump`).
- **(G)** login to `opeth` again and execute the command `traceroute 192.168.15.2` (the address of `nile`). Explain the output of this command.


# Routing Memento

- Enable routing on a machine (ip forward): `echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`
- Show routing table: `route -n`
- Define a default route: `route add default gw <@gateway>`
- Add a route to a specific network: `route add -net <@network> netmask <mask> gw <@gateway>`
- Add a route to a particular machine: `route add -host <@host> gw <@gateway>`
- To delete a rule, you must type the command `route del <â€¦>` with exactly the same arguments as for the add command.
- Check the route: `traceroute ip`
