# Lesson 5 - Scapy, modifying packages

We are reusing the network from lesson 3. Start the emulator with this command:

    /net/ens/qemunet/qemunet.sh -s ~/course-2018-networks/gw3-new.tgz

You have the following network, IP addresses and routing tables are already configured.

                grave
                  | .2
             ------------  192.168.100.0/24
                  | .1 (eth0)
     gateway   immortal
                  | .1 (eth1)             
            --------------  192.168.200.0/24
           .2 |        | .3              
            opeth     syl    

**Scapy** is a Python command interpreter that makes it possible to forge IP packets. You will find documentation and a tutorial on Scapy here:

http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/demo.html

or a bit more modern

http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/doc/usage.html

On `opeth`, run the `scapy` command. The prompt `>>>` indicates that you are now in the Scapy interpreter. To quit Scapy, hit <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>d</kbd>.

## Ping & Pong

To forge an IP packet, just call the `IP()` constructor. The `show()` method shows all IP packet fields initialized with default values:

    x = IP()
    x.show() # after this command you will see some output

To ping `syl`, an `echo-request` must be sent via the ICMP protocol over IP. Type the following commands:

    ping = IP( dst="192.168.200.3" ) / ICMP( type="echo-request" )
    pong = sr1( ping ) # if you can't read this properly,
    # the command is sr one, not sr L

- **(A)** What are the ping and pong variables - what do they do? What is the sr1() function good for?
- **(B)** Use the `show()` method of both `ping` and `pong` to display the contents of the packages. Note the encapsulation of ICMP in IP. Show me the output of the `show()` method for both variables and comment on each line what you think it means. (Or at least at the important lines, like `version`, `ttl`, `src`, `dst`, `type`)
- **(C)** Now, do a ping towards `grave` in the same way and show me the output of the `pong.show()`

<!-- ## Traceroute

In this exercise, we will code a manual traceroute into scapy. To do this, we will use the virtual network chain from TP2. Launch this topology:

    /net/ens/qemunet/qemunet.sh -x -s /net/ens/qemunet/demo/chain.tgz

IPs and routing tables are already configured.

First, test the traceroute command between opeth and nile.
Start scapy on opeth . Test the code below:

    x = IP( dst="147.210.15.2", ttl=1 ) / ICMP()  # @nile
    y = sr1(x)
    y.show()

- **(D)** What does the TTL field represent? Who answered? Why? Detail the encapsulation of the response received.
- **(E)** Repeat with `ttl=2`. What do you notice?
- **(F)** By relying on this principle, write a scapy program that performs a traceroute!

Tip: To write a Python loop ...

    >>>  for i in  range(10):
    ...    print  "iteration", i
    iteration 0
    iteration 1
    ...
    iteration 8
    iteration 9


Attention : Do not forget to add one or two spaces after '...' in the body of the loop (after the line `for` and before the `print` function).


## BONUS: Syn Scan

Load up the configuration from the first exercise (above):

    /net/ens/qemunet/qemunet.sh -x -s ~/gw3.tgz

- **(G)** What is a syn scan? What is the `nmap` command used for?

From opeth, run the command `nmap -sS -n @syl` to scan the ports of `syl`.
Now start Scapy on `opeth`.
To make a syn scan with Scapy, try to establish a TCP/IP connection to all ports (1 to 65535) of `syl`. If a service is available on a port on the target machine, then the server accepts the connection request by responding favorably.

To do a Scapy test, create a TCP/IP packet to port 80 of `syl` with the TCP flags field equal to `S` (SYN). Send this package and observe the answer.

    a = IP(???)/TCP(???) # instead of ??? you have to fill in your code
    b = sr1 (a)

Tip: Above I gave you a few links, look at the demo.html and usage.html links for finding the answer to this.

- **(H)** What is the TCP flag in the response you are getting?
- **(I)** Repeat for port 3333. What do you notice? Deduce a way to detect an open or closed port.
- **(J)** Complete the following program, to discover the ports of machine `nile` (from 1 to 1024) that are open and to display them like `nmap`.


    for p in range (1024):
    ...   if ???:
    ...     print  "OPEN" , p
    ...       

Warning : The test ??? Is not so obvious to find! Google is your friend :) -->
